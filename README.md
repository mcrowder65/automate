## MATT'S LIFE AUTOMATION PROJECT

This is an app where I am going to combine most apps I use into one.

Weight tracking (my fitness pal)

Working out (strong lifts, which i have abandoned for the simple notes app but I want data for machine learning)

Budgeting (I just use a google spreadsheet, but I want to be able to add things easily, and it will still just be added into google sheets)

My task manager (which is just an emailer)


Bringing these all together will be amazing and by the time i do i will probably have to go back and 
migrate them all to newer tech :(
